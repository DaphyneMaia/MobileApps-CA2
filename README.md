Report
- [x] A short report (300-1000 words) describing the challenges you faced, failed attempts and workarounds used, any helper or alternative libraries you have used, and what you have learned in the process.

To begin with, I have never faced such a difficult task before. Dispate off the layout everything else ended up with error. Buttons, recyclerView, JSON file, HTTP request, some things I have just giving up of doing such as downloading JSON file from the internet or update the remaining seats when pressing the back arrow.
I am very proud of my progress, because personally speaking kotlyn is a complete new language what makes it even more challenge when we are barelly learning java. Kotlin is more direct and has short commands, exactly what makes it harder than java to understand the syntax.
